Welcome to my lite version of DungeonQuest!
(Originally published as Drakborgen (Dragon's Keep) in 1985 by Alga, a subsidiary of BRIO AB.)

Be sure to fork and clone the front repository here : https://github.com/ToastMasterson/almostdungeonquestfrontend

Fork and clone this repository,
Run (From the Backend Directory):
    bundle install
    rails db:{create,migrate,seed}
    rails s

Then in the frontend directory run
    npm install
    npm start

Check the Frontend README.md for instructions and information.

Thank you for playing!

This project was made with a Ruby on Rails backend and a Reactjs frontend.

I do not own this game.
I borrowed the mechanics, images, and game board from the actual 1985 board game.
